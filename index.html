                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>Our restaurant has many interesting and attractive spaces, though not so many as the old Café
                            Anglais, with its 22 private rooms and lounges! Our ground floor dining room, with booths
                            and oak-panelled walls, is supplemented by a large, open dining area on the first floor,
                            which is popular with bigger groups for both sit-down dining and canapé receptions. Our
                            jewel in the crown is the private room. Our building is listed for this room’s floor to
                            ceiling, raised and fielded panelling dating from 1670. A George III mahogany table seats
                            16, and an open fire is sometimes lit in winter. We make no supplementary charge to hire
                            this space.

                    <h2>My recipies</h2>
                    <p>We operate a serious and ambitious kitchen. We proceed on the basis that the traditional British
                        kitchen is justly popular and capable of precise and delicate flavours. Its fall from grace in
                        more modern times is the consequence of a lamentable absence of formerly commonplace skills
                        among professional chefs.</p>
